        <dd>
          Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the
          class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss,
          please contact me ahead of time via email.

        <dt>Academic Honesty</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the <a
            href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml">Code of Academic Honesty</a> from the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/">IIT Student Handbook</a>. All work
            for this course should be your own original effort, including print and digital page
            design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
            open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
            legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of
            Humanities and the Associate Dean of Graduate Academic Affairs, who may take additional
            disciplinary action.

        <dt>Special Needs Statement</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In
            order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the
            Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in
            Life Sciences Room 218. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at
            disabilities@iit.edu
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
            ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email,
            at the start of the semester. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be adapted as
            required to ensure equitable participation.
