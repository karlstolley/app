# Course Syllabus and Materials for COM580: Web Application Development
Professor [Karl Stolley](http://karlstolley.com), Illinois Institute of Technology, Spring 2011

Rather than provide a course website/wiki as I usually do, for this course I'm
making all materials available as a Git repository; students may fork this
repository and make changes/pull requests--ensuring the functionality of the
wiki while moving away from the problems of long-term maintenance that wikis
inevitably face (at least if you prefer to host them yourself, as I do).
