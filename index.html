        <p>
          There are two different timelines to this class. There’s the timeline of the course
          calendar itself, but that may not match up at all with what you need to learn as you’re
          working on your projects. This is expected: web application development is the result of
          research-fueled craftsmanship, not a strict assembly line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wait around to learn something based on its placement on the calendar, you’re going
          to have a bad time. Individual learning and research is a huge part of web development;
          expect that at least some of the material will feel like review to you based on what
          you’ve already researched & learned on your own.

  <h3>Late Work</h3>
  <p>
    I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each
    project description.
  </p>

  <h2>Attendance and Participation</h2>
  <p>
    Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the class,
    and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss, please
    contact me ahead of time via email. Students missing more than two consecutive class meetings
    will automatically fail the course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding active participation: I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading.
    And I expect you to come prepared to discuss that reading.
  </p>

  <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>
    As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
    <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml">the Code of Academic Honesty as described in the IIT Student
    Handbook</a>. All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and
    digital page design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use
    of open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
    legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage, dissemination,
    and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the source’s terms of service,
    licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may
    violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the work is due.
    The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates the Code of
    Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will
    report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities, who may take additional
    disciplinary action, including reporting violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or
    Graduate Academic Affairs.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore essential to
    this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies as for any
    other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being
    unprepared for class.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it is
    your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance provided in
    class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to meet with me during
    my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to contact me via email or
    GChat, or our Campfire room, well in advance of project deadlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with
    nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is expected that
    you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more important than perfection.
    Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night before a project is due.
  </p>

  <h2>Accessibility and Special Needs Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to
    receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for
    Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S.
    State Street - 1C3-2. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at
    disabilities@iit.edu
  </p>
  <p>
    Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability
    to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email, at the start of
    the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be
    adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all students.
