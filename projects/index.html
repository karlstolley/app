        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For the first project, you will independently conceive, sketch, and build the alpha
          version of a Rails app. The app can be anything you believe to be interesting and useful.
          It needs only the most basic functionality and design to be viable; its purpose is largely
          to help you learn to work with Rails and make mistakes. Think of it as a proof of concept,
          both for the app itself and for your own initial skills in Rails development.

        <h4>Grading Note</h4>
        <p>
          This project is worth 25 points. 15 of those points are earned from the three in-progress
          posts and responses to the work of three other students (2 points for your work; 1 point
          for each of the three responses to other students). Those points are all or nothing: you
          either submit your in-progress work and respond to three other students on time—or you
          don’t. The remaining 10 points will be determined based on the final version you submit.

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For the beta app, you will work in teams of two or three. Your group can either begin
          again with the app created by one of your group’s members for Project One, or you can
          pursue an idea for an entirely different app. Requirements and deliverables are similar to
          those of Project One; however, you will more fully flesh out the design of your app, both
          functionally and visually. It must include a way to authenticate users, preferably using
          an OAuth-based schema.
