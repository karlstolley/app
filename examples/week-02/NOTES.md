# DOM Scripting & jQuery
*Notes and activities from week two, 1/24/2010*

Tonight we’ll talk about some of the concepts behind the Document Object Model (DOM) and DOM 
Scripting. We’ll also talk a little bit about the agile method known as pair programming. 

We’ll also get everyone’s Git configured on the lab machines, following the advice at 
[GitHub](http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/).

Then we’ll do some work building a form using HTML5 with enhancements (visual/UI) care of jQuery.
We’ll do this using the agile method known as pair programming (with a slight modification--rather
than having one ‘driver’ and one ‘navigator,’ we’ll switch roles after a period of time).

For next week, we’ll be reading Dan Cederholm’s _CSS3 for Web Designers_, where you’ll see how CSS3
is poised to replace some of the little enhancements at the UX level that currently require the
overhead and overkill firepower of jQuery and other DOM Scripting/JavaScript solutions.
